This repo contains most of the reinforcement learning environments referred in the book [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction(2nd)](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html). You may also view the [notebooks](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearningAnIntroduction.jl/tree/master/notebooks) for how to reproduce most of the figures on that book.
